Particle System Simulation Space is used to control the simulation of a particle system.

In Unity, Particle Systems are used to create visual effects, such as explosions, fire, smoke and other particle-based phenomena. The Particle System Simulation
Space property determines the coordinate space in which the particle system's simulation will take place.
There are three options for the Simulation Space property:

1. World: The particle system's simulation will take place in the world space. This means that the particle system's position, velocity,
   and acceleration will be relative to the world coordinate system.

2. Local: The particle system's simulation will take place in the local space of its parent GameObject. This means that the particle system's position,
   velocity, and acceleration will be relative to the parent GameObject's coordinate system.

3. Custom: The particle system's simulation will take place in a custom space, which is defined by a Transform component attached to the same GameObject
   as the Particle System.

The Simulation Space property affects how the particle system behaves and how it is affected by the position, rotation,
and scale of its parent GameObject or custom Transform.
