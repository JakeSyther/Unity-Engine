Is a property of the Vector3 class in Unity engine. It represents the square of the magnitude (length) of a 3D vector.
The square of the magnitude is used instead of the magnitude for performance reasons, as the square is faster to calculate than the square root.

The magnitude of a vector is a scalar value that represents the length of the vector.
The square of the magnitude is simply the magnitude squared. The property sqrMagnitude is used to get the square of the magnitude of the velocity vector.

Example of how sqrMagnitude can be used in a script:
--------------------------------------------------------
Vector3 velocity = new Vector3(3, 4, 5);

if (velocity.sqrMagnitude > 25) {
    Debug.Log("Velocity is greater than 5");
} else {
    Debug.Log("Velocity is less than or equal to 5");
}
--------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the velocity vector has a magnitude of Mathf.Sqrt(3*3 + 4*4 + 5*5) = 7.071067812f, which is greater than 5.
The output will be "Velocity is greater than 5".
