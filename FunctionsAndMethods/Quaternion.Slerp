Quaternion.Slerp is a function in Unity that performs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) between two rotations.
It's a useful tool for smoothing out rotation animations or blending between rotations.

Official documentation on Quaternion.Slerp in Unity: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Slerp.html

Simple example that demonstrates how Quaternion.Slerp can be used to smoothly rotate an object towards a target rotation over time:


public class RotateTowardsTarget : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target;
    public float rotationSpeed = 5.0f;

    private void Update()
    {
        // Calculate the direction from the current object's rotation to the target rotation
        Vector3 direction = (target.position - transform.position).normalized;
        Quaternion targetRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(direction);

        // Smoothly rotate towards the target rotation over time
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, targetRotation, Time.deltaTime * rotationSpeed);
    }
}


The Update function is used to calculate the direction from the current object to the target and then creates a target rotation
using Quaternion.LookRotation. Then Quaternion.Slerp is used to smoothly rotate the object towards the target rotation over time by taking the current rotation,
the target rotation, and the rotationSpeed as inputs. The result is a smooth, gradual rotation towards the target.
