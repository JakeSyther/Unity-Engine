FindObjectOfType is a method in Unity that searches the scene for an object of a specific type and returns the first one that it finds.
It is a static method, so you can call it from anywhere in your code, and it takes a single argument specifying the type of object to search for.

Here's an example:
---------------------------------------------------------------
// Find the first Camera object in the scene and disable it
Camera camera = FindObjectOfType<Camera>();
camera.enabled = false;
---------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we use FindObjectOfType to get the first Camera object in the scene and disable it.
This is a simple example, but FindObjectOfType can be useful in many situations, such as finding a game manager object or a player object.

It's worth noting that FindObjectOfType can be expensive in terms of performance, especially if called frequently or on a large scene with many objects.
It's generally a good practice to cache the results of FindObjectOfType in a variable if you need to access the object frequently or repeatedly.
This can improve performance by avoiding the need to search the scene every time you need to access the object.
