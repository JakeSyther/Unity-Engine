The Mathf.Lerp function calculates the linear interpolation between two values.
It takes three arguments: two float values a and b and a float t that represents the interpolation factor.

An example of how Mathf.Lerp can be used in a script:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float a = 0.0f;
float b = 10.0f;
float t = 0.5f;

float result = Mathf.Lerp(a, b, t);

Debug.Log("The result of linear interpolation between " + a + " and " + b + " with t = " + t + " is: " + result);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, Mathf.Lerp is used to calculate the linear interpolation between 0.0f and 10.0f with t = 0.5f. The result is 5.0f, which is the average of a and b.
The output will be "The result of linear interpolation between 0 and 10 with t = 0.5 is: 5".

The Mathf.Lerp function is often used in game development for animation and movement, where values need to be smoothly interpolated between two points over time.



Another example of how Mathf.Lerp can be used:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float startPosition = 0.0f;
float endPosition = 100.0f;
float t = 0.75f;

float currentPosition = Mathf.Lerp(startPosition, endPosition, t);

Debug.Log("The current position is: " + currentPosition);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, Mathf.Lerp is used to calculate the current position of an object that is moving from startPosition to endPosition.
The t value represents the interpolation factor, with 0.0f representing the startPosition and 1.0f representing the endPosition.
In this case, t = 0.75f, which means the object is 75% of the way from startPosition to endPosition.

The Mathf.Lerp function calculates the current position of the object by finding the linear interpolation between startPosition and
endPosition with t = 0.75f. The result is 75.0f, which is the current position of the object. The output will be "The current position is: 75".
