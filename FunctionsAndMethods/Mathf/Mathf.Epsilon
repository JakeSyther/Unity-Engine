It represents the smallest positive single-precision floating-point number that is greater than zero.
Mathf.Epsilon is commonly used in numerical calculations and computer graphics as a small tolerance value.
This value is used to compare floating-point numbers for equality, since direct equality comparison of floating-point numbers can often result in incorrect
results due to rounding errors. Instead, the comparison checks if the difference between two floating-point numbers is smaller than Mathf.Epsilon,
which is considered close enough to equal.

For example, in the following code snippet, the condition Mathf.Abs(a - b) < Mathf.Epsilon is used to check if a and b are equal:
--------------------------------------------
float a = 0.1f + 0.2f;
float b = 0.3f;

if (Mathf.Abs(a - b) < Mathf.Epsilon) {
    Debug.Log("a and b are equal");
} else {
    Debug.Log("a and b are not equal");
}
--------------------------------------------
Two float variables a and b are defined and initialized. a is set to 0.1f + 0.2f and b is set to 0.3f.
The if statement checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than Mathf.Epsilon. The Mathf.Abs function is used to calculate the absolute difference,
which returns the absolute value of the difference between two numbers.

If the difference is less than Mathf.Epsilon, the message "a and b are equal" is logged to the console.
If the difference is not less than Mathf.Epsilon, the message "a and b are not equal" is logged to the console.

In this particular example, the output will be "a and b are equal", even though a and b are not exactly equal due to floating-point rounding errors.
The comparison uses Mathf.Epsilon as a tolerance value to account for these rounding errors and consider the values equal.

In conclusion, Mathf.Epsilon is a small value used in floating-point equality comparison to account for rounding errors and ensure correct results.
