The Transform.root property in Unity refers to the top-most parent Transform component in the hierarchy.
In other words, it returns the highest Transform in the hierarchy that this Transform is a child of.
If the Transform has no parent, then it returns itself. The Transform.root property can be useful for finding the top-level object that a Transform is a part of,
or for navigating the hierarchy to perform actions on all of the children of a particular parent.

An example of how you can use the Transform.root property in a script:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
using UnityEngine;

public class RootExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Transform rootTransform = transform.root;
        Debug.Log("The root transform is: " + rootTransform.name);
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the Start method retrieves the root Transform by accessing the transform.root property,
and then outputs its name to the console using the Debug.Log method. If you attach this script to an object in your scene,
you will be able to see the name of the root Transform in the console when the scene starts.
