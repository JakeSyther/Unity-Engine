ScreenPointToRay is a method in the Camera class in Unity that converts a screen space point (specified in pixels) into a ray that can be
used for things like physics raycasting or detecting mouse clicks. 
The resulting ray starts at the camera's near plane and extends through the specified screen point in the camera's view.

Here's the syntax for using ScreenPointToRay:
---------------------------------------------------
public Ray ScreenPointToRay(Vector3 position);
---------------------------------------------------

The position parameter specifies the screen point to convert, in pixels. This method returns a Ray object representing the resulting ray.



Here's an example of how to use ScreenPointToRay to perform a physics raycast:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RaycastHit hit;
Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);

if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
{
    // A physics object was hit
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the ScreenPointToRay method is used to create a new ray that starts at the camera's near plane and extends through 
the mouse position in the camera's view. This ray is then passed to the Physics.Raycast method, which performs a physics raycast using the given ray.
If a physics object is hit, information about the hit is stored in the hit variable.

Note that ScreenPointToRay can also be used to perform other types of raycasting, such as for detecting mouse clicks on objects in the scene.
In general, this method is useful any time you need to convert a screen space point into a ray in the scene.
