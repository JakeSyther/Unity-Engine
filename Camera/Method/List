There are many methods available in the Camera class in Unity. Here's a list of some of the most commonly used methods:

- ScreenPointToRay: Converts a screen space point to a ray that can be used for physics raycasting or other purposes.
- WorldToScreenPoint: Converts a world space point to a screen space point, in pixels.
- ViewportToWorldPoint: Converts a point in the camera's viewport (specified as a normalized coordinate between 0 and 1) to a world space point.
- ScreenToWorldPoint: Converts a screen space point to a world space point.
- ViewportToScreenPoint: Converts a point in the camera's viewport to a screen space point, in pixels.
- WorldToViewportPoint: Converts a world space point to a point in the camera's viewport (specified as a normalized coordinate between 0 and 1).
- WorldToCameraMatrix: Returns the matrix that transforms points from world space to camera space.
- CameraToWorldMatrix: Returns the matrix that transforms points from camera space to world space.
- CalculateObliqueMatrix: Calculates an oblique projection matrix for the camera.
- Render: Renders the camera's view to a render texture or the screen.
- ResetProjectionMatrix: Resets the camera's projection matrix to its default value.


These are just a few of the many methods available in the Camera class. 
Each method has its own specific purpose and usage, and the full list of methods can be found in the Unity documentation.
