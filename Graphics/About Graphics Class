Graphics is a static class in the UnityEngine namespace that provides a variety of graphics-related functionality,
including rendering, drawing, and working with textures and meshes.

Some of the main functions and properties provided by the Graphics class:

1. DrawMesh(): Draws a Mesh object using a specified Material.
2. Blit(): Copies a Texture or RenderTexture to another RenderTexture with an optional material and shader.
3. ClearRandomWriteTargets(): Clears any active compute buffer or texture targets.
4. CreateCommandBuffer(): Creates a new CommandBuffer object that can be used to record and execute rendering commands.
5. SetRenderTarget(): Sets the current render target for subsequent rendering operations.
6. ActiveTier: Gets the current graphics API level.
7. multiThreaded: Gets or sets whether the rendering is performed on multiple threads.

In addition, the Graphics class also provides several properties and functions for working with textures and materials,
such as DrawTexture() for drawing a 2D texture, and GetActiveColorSpace() for getting the active color space used by the rendering system.

The Graphics class is used extensively in Unity for rendering and graphics-related operations, and it provides a lot of low-level control and customization
options for developers. However, because it is a low-level API, it can be more difficult to use than the higher-level functions and classes provided by Unity,
and it is generally recommended only for advanced users with specific needs or optimizations.
