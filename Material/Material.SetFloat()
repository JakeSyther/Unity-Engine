Material.SetFloat is a method that allows you to set a float value for a specific property of a material. 
This method is often used to control the appearance of an object at runtime.

Here's an example of how to use Material.SetFloat:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Material material;
    public float cutoff;

    void Update()
    {
        // Set the cutoff property of the material to the specified value
        material.SetFloat("_Cutoff", cutoff);
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have a Material object and a float variable named cutoff. We want to control the alpha cutoff value of the material,
which determines which parts of the object are visible and which are transparent.

To do this, we call the SetFloat method on the material and pass in two arguments: the name of the property we want to set, and the float value we want to set it to.
In this case, we are setting the "_Cutoff" property of the material to the cutoff variable.

Note that the name of the property we want to set is specified as a string with an underscore at the beginnig. This is because material properties in Unity are 
typically stored as shader parameters, and shader parameters are conventionally named with an underscore to distinguish them from other variables in the script.

MAterial.SetFloat can be used to control a variety of materials properties, such as color values, metallic and smoothness values, and emmision values. By changing 
properties at runtime, you can create and interactive visuals in your Unity scene.

Different materials in Unity can use different shaders, and each shader has a different set of properties that can be set with "Material.SetFloat". For example,
a material that uses the Standart shader in Unity will have properties like "_Color", "_Metallic", "_Smoothness", and "_NormalMap" 
that can be set with "Material.SetFloat"

On the other hand, a material that uses a custom shader created by the user may have a different set of properties available,
and these properties may not have the same naming conventions as the properties on the Standard shader.

Finally, it's worth noting that some shader properties may not be exposed in the inspector by default.
This means that you won't be able to set the property directly from the inspector, but you can still set it using Material.SetFloat
(or the appropriate method for the property type). To do this, you'll need to know the name of the property and the appropriate value to set it to.
