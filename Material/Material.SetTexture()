Material.SetTexture is a method in Unity's Material class that allows you to set a texture for a specific property of a material. 
This method is often used to change the appearance of an object at runtime by swapping textures.


Here is an example of how to use Material.SetTexture:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Material material;
    public Texture texture;

    void Start()
    {
        // Set the main texture property of the material to the specified texture
        material.SetTexture("_MainTex", texture);
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have a Material object and a Texture object. We want to set the main texture property of the material to the specified texture.

To do this, we call the SetTexture method on the material and pass in two arguments:
the name of the property we want to set, and the texture we want to set it to. In this case, we are setting the "_MainTex" property of the material
to the texture variable.

Note that the name of the property we want to set is specified as a string with an underscore at the beginning.
This is because material properties in Unity are typically stored as shader parameters,
and shader parameters are conventionally named with an underscore to distinguish them from other variables in the script.

Material.SetTexture can be used to set textures for a variety of material properties, such as normal maps, emission maps, and reflection maps.
By swapping textures at runtime, you can create dynamic and interactive visuals in your Unity scene.
