The UnityEngine.AI.NavMesh class provides functionality for building and using navigation meshes in a Unity scene.
A navigation mesh is a collection of triangles that represent walkable surfaces in a scene,
and it can be used by the Unity engine to find paths for characters or other objects to navigate.

Here are some of the key methods and properties of the NavMesh class:

Methods:

* AddNavMeshData: Adds new navigation data to the scene.
* BuildNavMesh: Builds a navigation mesh based on the current scene objects and settings.
* FindClosestEdge: Finds the closest point on a navigation mesh edge to a specified position.
* FindClosestEdgeAndPoly: Finds the closest point on a navigation mesh edge to a specified position, and also returns the corresponding polygon.
* FindPath: Finds a path from a starting position to an ending position on the navigation mesh.
* GetNavMeshData: Retrieves the navigation data for the current scene.
* Raycast: Casts a ray against the navigation mesh, and returns information about any hit.

Properties:

* isScanning: Indicates whether the navigation mesh is currently being built or updated.
* pathfindingIterationsPerFrame: The maximum number of pathfinding iterations that can be performed per frame.
* avoidancePredictionTime: The time horizon used by the navigation system for predicting collisions and avoiding obstacles.
* obstacleAvoidanceType: The type of obstacle avoidance algorithm to use (either "NoObstacleAvoidance" or "LowQualityObstacleAvoidance").

An example of how to use the NavMesh class to find a path from one position to another:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.AI;

public class NavMeshPathfinder : MonoBehaviour
{
    private NavMeshAgent agent;
    public Transform target;

    private void Start()
    {
        agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>();
        agent.SetDestination(target.position);
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we use the NavMeshAgent component to move the game object to a specified target position.
The NavMeshAgent component internally uses the NavMesh class to find a path to the target.
