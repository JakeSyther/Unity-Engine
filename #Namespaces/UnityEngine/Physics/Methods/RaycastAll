Physics.RaycastAll is a method in Unity that casts a ray against colliders in the scene and returns all hits in an array.

The method takes three parameters:

* origin: The starting point of the ray.
* direction: The direction of the ray.
* maxDistance: The maximum distance of the ray.

It returns an array of RaycastHit objects, which contain information about the colliders that were hit by the ray. 
Each RaycastHit object contains information such as the distance from the ray's origin to the hit, the point where the ray hit the collider,
and the normal of the surface at the point of intersection.

Physics.RaycastAll is useful when you need to get information about all the colliders that intersect with a ray, instead of just the first one that is hit. 
This can be used for things like detecting all objects in a line of sight, or checking for all objects in the vicinity of the player.


An example of using Physics.RaycastAll:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

using UnityEngine;

public class RaycastAllExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float maxDistance = 10f;

    void Update()
    {
        Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
        RaycastHit[] hits = Physics.RaycastAll(ray, maxDistance);
        if (hits.Length > 0)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < hits.Length; i++)
            {
                RaycastHit hit = hits[i];
                Debug.Log("Hit " + hit.collider.gameObject.name);
            }
        }
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, a ray is cast from the mouse position in the direction of the camera. 
The method Physics.RaycastAll is called with the ray and a maximum distance of 10 units. 
The array of RaycastHit objects is then looped through, and each hit is logged to the console.
