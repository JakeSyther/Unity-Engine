The Emit() function is used to manually emit particles from a ParticleSystem component in Unity.
It allows you to specify the number of particles to emit and their initial properties, such as their position, velocity, and lifetime.

The Emit() function can be called in response to various events, such as collisions, triggers, or user input, to create particle effects in your game. 
It is also useful for creating one-time particle effects, such as explosions or special effects.

Here are the main properties and parameters of the Emit() function:


- EmitParams                                  : This is a struct that contains the parameters for the emitted particles, such as the position, velocity, and lifetime.
                                                It has several properties, such as position, velocity, startLifetime, startSize, and startColor, 
                                                which can be set to customize the properties of the emitted particles.


- int count                                   : This is the number of particles to emit.


- void Emit(EmitParams emitParams, int count) : This is the main function used to emit particles. 
                                                It takes an EmitParams object that defines the initial properties of the particles
                                                and an integer that specifies the number of particles to emit.
                                                
                                                
                                                
An example of using the Emit() function to create a one-time particle effect:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

using UnityEngine;

public class ParticleEmitter : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ParticleSystem particleSystem;

    void Start()
    {
        EmitParticles();
    }

    void EmitParticles()
    {
        ParticleSystem.EmitParams emitParams = new ParticleSystem.EmitParams();
        emitParams.position = transform.position;
        emitParams.velocity = Vector3.up * 5;
        emitParams.startLifetime = 3f;
        emitParams.startSize = 0.2f;
        emitParams.startColor = Color.red;

        particleSystem.Emit(emitParams, 50);
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have a ParticleSystem component that we want to use to create a particle effect. 
We define a EmitParticles() function that creates an EmitParams object with the desired properties for the emitted particles.
We then call the Emit() function of the ParticleSystem component with the EmitParams object and the number of particles we want to emit.

This will create a one-time particle effect of 50 particles at the position of the ParticleEmitter game object,
with an initial upward velocity, a lifetime of 3 seconds, a size of 0.2, and a red color.
