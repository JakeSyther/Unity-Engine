In Unity, a Quaternion represents a rotation in 3D space. It is a four-dimensional vector that consists of a scalar and a three-dimensional vector.
Quaternions are often used for interpolating between rotations and are used to avoid the problems associated with Euler angles.

The Quaternion struct in Unity has the following properties:

x, y, z, w: The four components of the quaternion.

And the following methods:

* Quaternion.Euler: Returns a rotation that rotates around the x, y, and z axes.
* Quaternion.LookRotation: Creates a rotation with the specified forward and upwards directions.
* Quaternion.Slerp: Spherically interpolates between two rotations.
* Quaternion.Angle: Returns the angle in degrees between two rotations.
* Quaternion.FromToRotation: Returns a rotation that rotates from a specified from direction to a specified to direction.


Here's an example of using a quaternion in Unity:

// Rotate the object 90 degrees around the y-axis
Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0f, 90f, 0f);
transform.rotation = rotation;


In this example, we create a Quaternion representing a 90 degree rotation around the y-axis using the Euler method,
and then set the rotation of an object to that quaternion.

Another example is slerping between two rotations:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Spherically interpolate between the two rotations over 2 seconds
Quaternion startRotation = transform.rotation;
Quaternion endRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0f, 180f, 0f);
float elapsedTime = 0f;
float duration = 2f;

while (elapsedTime < duration)
{
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(startRotation, endRotation, elapsedTime / duration);
    elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;
    yield return null;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we use Quaternion.Slerp to smoothly interpolate between the start rotation of an object and a rotation of 180 degrees
around the y-axis over a period of 2 seconds. The rotation is updated every frame using a coroutine in Unity.
