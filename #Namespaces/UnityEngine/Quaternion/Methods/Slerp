Quaternion.Slerp is a method in Unity that performs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) between two quaternions.
It is used to smoothly interpolate between two rotations over a given amount of time, creating a smooth animation.

Here is some information about Quaternion.Slerp:

Method Signature:
public static Quaternion Slerp(Quaternion a, Quaternion b, float t);

Parameters:

a: The starting rotation.
b: The target rotation.
t: The interpolation value, usually a value between 0 and 1.

Return Value:

The resulting interpolated rotation as a Quaternion.
Details:

The SLERP operation creates a rotation that smoothly interpolates between two rotations.
The t parameter determines how much of the rotation is from the starting point (0.0) to the target (1.0).
The resulting rotation is normalized to a unit quaternion.



An example usage of Quaternion.Slerp:

public float speed = 1.0f;
public Transform start;
public Transform end;

void Update()
{
    float t = Mathf.PingPong(Time.time * speed, 1.0f);
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(start.rotation, end.rotation, t);
}

This script will smoothly interpolate between the starting rotation of the "start" transform and the target rotation of the
"end" transform, based on a ping-pong value of time.
