"RaycastHit" is a structure in Unity that represents the information returned by a raycast, including the point of intersection,
the normal of the surface at the intersection point, the distance to the intersection, and the game object that was hit.

Here are some of the key properties and methods of the RaycastHit structure:


Properties:

- point: The point in 3D space where the ray intersected with an object.
- normal: The normal vector of the surface at the intersection point.
- distance: The distance from the ray's origin to the intersection point.
- collider: The collider component of the object that was hit.
- rigidbody: The rigidbody component of the object that was hit (if it has one).
- transform: The transform component of the object that was hit.
- gameObject: The game object that was hit.


Methods:

- GetComponent<T>(): Returns the component of type T attached to the game object that was hit (if there is one).
- TransformDirection(): Transforms a direction vector from local space to world space.



Here is an example of how to use RaycastHit in a script:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class RaycastExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float maxDistance = 10f;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out RaycastHit hit, maxDistance))
            {
                Debug.Log("Hit object: " + hit.collider.gameObject.name);
            }
        }
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the script casts a ray from the camera to the mouse position on the screen using Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay().
If the ray hits an object within a maximum distance of maxDistance, the script logs the name of the hit object to the console using Debug.Log().
The information about the hit is stored in a RaycastHit variable named hit.
