UnityEngine.StateMachineBehaviour is a class in Unity that allows you to create custom behaviours that can be added to state machines in Animator controllers.
These behaviours can be used to add custom logic and functionality to your animations, such as playing sounds, spawning particles, or updating variables.

Here are some of the key features and capabilities of StateMachineBehaviour:

* StateMachineBehaviour is a subclass of UnityEngine.ScriptableObject, which means that each behaviour is its own asset
  that can be saved and reused across multiple state machines.

* You can create custom behaviours by subclassing StateMachineBehaviour and overriding its methods, 
  such as OnStateEnter, OnStateUpdate, OnStateExit, and so on. 
  These methods are called by the state machine at specific points during the animation playback, allowing you to run custom code.

* Behaviours can access and modify the state machine's parameters and variables,
  allowing you to synchronize animations with game logic and make them responsive to player input.

* Behaviours can be added to state machines in the Animator window, either by dragging them from the Project view
  or by creating them on-the-fly using the Add Behaviour button in the Inspector.
  You can add multiple behaviours to a single state, or to the state machine as a whole.

* Behaviours can be enabled or disabled at runtime, allowing you to control their behaviour dynamically based on game events or conditions.

* StateMachineBehaviour supports serialization and deserialization, which means that you can save the state of a behaviour at runtime and reload it later.
  This can be useful for creating save systems or for undo/redo functionality.

* StateMachineBehaviour can be used in conjunction with other animation-related Unity features, such as blend trees, mecanim events,
  and avatar masks, to create complex and responsive animations.


Overall, StateMachineBehaviour is a powerful tool that allows you to extend the functionality of your animations and make them more interactive and dynamic.
It's particularly useful for creating character animations in games, where you often need to synchronize animations with gameplay mechanics and player input.
