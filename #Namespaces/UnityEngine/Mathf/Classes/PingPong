The Mathf.PingPong function returns a value that "bounces" back and forth between 0 and the specified length, based on the input value.


Here is the signature of the function:
public static float PingPong(float t, float length);

Here is what each parameter means:

t: The input value that determines the position of the "bounce". This value must be non-negative.
length: The total length of the "bounce". The returned value will always be between 0 and this value.

And here are some additional details:

The function uses a sine wave to interpolate between 0 and length.
If t is greater than or equal to length, the function returns 0, indicating that the "bounce" has started over again.
The function is often used in game development to create repeating, oscillating motion.



Here is an example usage of Mathf.PingPong:
public class PingPongExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 1.0f;
    public float length = 5.0f;

    void Update()
    {
        float position = Mathf.PingPong(Time.time * speed, length);
        transform.position = new Vector3(position, 0, 0);
    }
}

In this example, the object's position along the X axis is set to the value returned by Mathf.PingPong,
which creates a repeating motion that bounces back and forth along the X axis. 
The speed parameter controls how quickly the motion moves, and the length parameter controls the distance of the "bounce".
