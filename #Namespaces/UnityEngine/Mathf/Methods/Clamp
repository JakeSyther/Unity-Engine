Mathf.Clamp is a method in the Mathf class that is used to restrict a value to a specific range.

Here are the details of Mathf.Clamp:
public static float Clamp(float value, float min, float max);

Parameters:

value (float): The input value to be clamped.
min (float): The minimum value that value can be.
max (float): The maximum value that value can be

Return Value:

Returns value if it is within the range [min, max]. Otherwise, if value is less than min, the method returns min. If value is greater than max, the method returns max.

Description:

The Mathf.Clamp method is used to restrict a given input value value to a specific range. The range is defined by the min and max parameters.
If value is within the range [min, max], it is returned as-is. Otherwise, if value is less than min, min is returned.
If value is greater than max, max is returned.
Mathf.Clamp can be used to ensure that a value does not exceed a certain limit or falls below a certain minimum value.

Example:
float health = 75.0f;
health = Mathf.Clamp(health, 0.0f, 100.0f);

In this example, the health variable is clamped between 0.0f and 100.0f. If the initial value of health is less than 0.0f, it is set to 0.0f.
If the initial value of health is greater than 100.0f, it is set to 100.0f. If the initial value of health is between 0.0f and 100.0f, it is left unchanged.
