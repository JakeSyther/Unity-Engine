Mathf.CeilToInt is a method in the Mathf class in Unity that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given float value.
It takes a single parameter, f, which is the float value to be rounded up to the nearest integer.

The Mathf.CeilToInt method performs the same operation as Mathf.Ceil, but returns the result as an integer value rather than a float value. 
This can be useful in cases where you need to perform integer-based calculations or comparisons using a float value.


An example usage of Mathf.CeilToInt:

float value = 4.6f;
int result = Mathf.CeilToInt(value); // result will be 5

In this example, value is a float value of 4.6, and Mathf.CeilToInt(value) is used to round up the value to the nearest integer, which is 5.

It's worth noting that Mathf.CeilToInt can also be used with negative values, in which case it will round the value up to the nearest integer value that is greater 
than or equal to the given float value. 

For example:

float value = -2.8f;
int result = Mathf.CeilToInt(value); // result will be -2


In this example, value is a negative float value of -2.8, and Mathf.CeilToInt(value) is used to round up the value to the nearest integer, which is -2.
