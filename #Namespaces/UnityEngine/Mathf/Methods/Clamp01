Mathf.Clamp01 is a static method in the Mathf class in Unity that clamps a value to the range of 0 to 1.

Here's the signature of the method:

public static float Clamp01(float value)

value: The value to be clamped.
The method returns the input value if it is between 0 and 1, otherwise it returns 0 if the value is less than 0, or 1 if the value is greater than 1.

Here's an example usage:
float input = 1.5f;
float clampedInput = Mathf.Clamp01(input); // clampedInput = 1.0f

In the above example, the input value of 1.5f is greater than 1, so Clamp01 returns 1.0f.

Mathf.Clamp01 is commonly used for normalizing values, such as when working with color or opacity values, where the valid range is 0 to 1.
