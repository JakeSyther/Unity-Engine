MonoBehaviour is a base class in Unity that allows scripts to interact with the GameObjects and Components in a scene.
It provides a range of built-in functions that can be overridden to add custom behavior to game objects and respond to events like updates, collisions, and input.
MonoBehaviour is commonly used in Unity game development to create interactive game objects, control animations and UI elements, manage game state and much more.
