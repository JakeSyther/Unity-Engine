OnControllerColliderHit is a function in Unity's MonoBehaviour class that is called when a character controller collides with a rigidbody or a collider.
It takes a ControllerColliderHit object as its only parameter, which contains information about the collision.

Here are some things to keep in mind when using OnControllerColliderHit:

* "OnControllerColliderHit" is only called when a character controller collides with a rigidbody or a collider that is marked as a trigger.
* "OnControllerColliderHit" is called before the Update() function, so you can use it to modify the character's movement before it is processed for the frame.
* The "ControllerColliderHit" object that is passed to OnControllerColliderHit contains information about the collision, 
  including the point of contact, the normal of the surface that was hit, and the GameObject that was hit.
* If you want to stop the character's movement when it collides with an object, you can set the character's velocity to zero in the OnControllerColliderHit function.

An example of how to use OnControllerColliderHit to stop a character's movement when it collides with an object:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void OnControllerColliderHit(ControllerColliderHit hit) {
    // Check if the object that was hit is a wall
    if (hit.gameObject.tag == "Wall") {
        // Stop the character's movement
        GetComponent<CharacterController>().velocity = Vector3.zero;
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the OnControllerColliderHit function checks if the object that was hit has a tag of "Wall". 
If it does, the function sets the character's velocity to zero, which stops its movement.
