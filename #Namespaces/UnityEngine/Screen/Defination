UnityEngine.Screen is a static class in the Unity engine that provides information about the screen and display settings.

Here are some of the key properties and methods of the Screen class:

- currentResolution: Returns the current screen resolution as a Resolution object.
- fullScreen: Gets or sets whether the application should run in full-screen mode.
- width: Gets the width of the screen in pixels.
- height: Gets the height of the screen in pixels.
- dpi: Gets the DPI (dots per inch) of the screen.
- orientation: Gets the current screen orientation (portrait or landscape).
- SetResolution(): Sets the screen resolution and display mode.

These properties and methods can be used to customize the display settings of a Unity game or application, 
such as changing the resolution, setting full-screen mode, or detecting the current screen DPI or orientation.

For example, you could use the Screen.width and Screen.height properties to set the size of a UI element in relation to the screen size, 
or use the Screen.fullScreen property to toggle between windowed and full-screen display modes.


An example script that demonstrates some of the properties and methods of the Screen class:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
using UnityEngine;

public class ScreenInfo : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Get the current screen resolution
        Resolution res = Screen.currentResolution;
        Debug.Log("Current resolution: " + res.width + "x" + res.height);

        // Get the screen DPI
        float dpi = Screen.dpi;
        Debug.Log("Screen DPI: " + dpi);

        // Get the screen orientation
        ScreenOrientation orientation = Screen.orientation;
        Debug.Log("Screen orientation: " + orientation);

        // Set the screen resolution to 800x600
        Screen.SetResolution(800, 600, false);

        // Check if the application is running in full-screen mode
        bool isFullScreen = Screen.fullScreen;
        Debug.Log("Is full-screen mode? " + isFullScreen);
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this script, we first use the Screen.currentResolution property to get the current screen resolution and log it to the console. 
We then use the Screen.dpi property to get the screen DPI and log it to the console as well.

Next, we use the Screen.orientation property to get the current screen orientation and log it to the console.

After that, we use the Screen.SetResolution() method to set the screen resolution to 800x600.

Finally, we use the Screen.fullScreen property to check if the application is running in full-screen mode, and log the result to the console.

This is just a basic example, but it shows how you can use the properties and methods of the Screen class to customize
the display settings of your Unity game or application.
