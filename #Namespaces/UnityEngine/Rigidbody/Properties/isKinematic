In Unity, the isKinematic property of a Rigidbody component determines whether the object is affected by physics forces or not.

When isKinematic is set to true, the object will not be affected by physics forces such as gravity, collisions, and forces applied by other objects. 
Instead, it can only be moved by directly manipulating its transform component.

An example:

Let's say you have a Rigidbody attached to a cube and isKinematic is set to true. 
If you apply a force to the cube with AddForce() function, the cube will not be moved by the force,
but it can still be moved by directly setting its position or rotation through the transform component.

using UnityEngine;

public class KinematicExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    Rigidbody rb;
    public float speed = 10.0f;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        rb.isKinematic = true;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Move the cube left and right with arrow keys
        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontalInput, 0, 0);
        transform.position += movement * speed * Time.deltaTime;
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        Debug.Log("Collision Detected");
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this example, the Rigidbody component is set to isKinematic = true in the Start() function. 
As a result, the cube will not be affected by physics forces and can only be moved by directly manipulating its transform.

However, even though the cube is not affected by physics forces, it can still detect collisions with other objects.
In the OnCollisionEnter() function, a debug message will be printed whenever the cube collides with another object.
