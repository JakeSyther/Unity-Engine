The Rigidbody.velocity property is a vector that represents the current linear velocity of the rigidbody in three-dimensional space.
It is used to set or get the velocity of the object in units per second.

For example, if you want to add a force to the rigidbody to make it move, you can set its velocity directly.
Let's say you have a player object with a rigidbody component and you want to make it move in the direction of a user input.
You can do that by adding a force to the player's rigidbody using the velocity property:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 10f;
    Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontal, 0f, vertical);

        rb.velocity = movement * moveSpeed;
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above example, we get a reference to the rigidbody component on the player object in the Start function, 
and then in the FixedUpdate function we get user input for horizontal and vertical movement.
We then create a new vector movement and set it to the horizontal and vertical input. 
Finally, we set the velocity of the rigidbody to the movement vector multiplied by the moveSpeed variable.
This will cause the player object to move in the direction of the user input.

Note that the velocity property is affected by forces and gravity, so you may need to adjust the physics settings to get the desired behavior.
Additionally, it is recommended to modify the velocity of a rigidbody in the FixedUpdate function rather than
the Update function to ensure that physics calculations are performed correctly.
