AddForce() is a method in the Rigidbody class in Unity, which allows you to apply a force to a rigidbody. 

Here's an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class AddForceExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rigidbody rb;
    public float force = 10f;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            rb.AddForce(transform.forward * force, ForceMode.Impulse);
        }
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have a Rigidbody component attached to a game object, and we want to apply a force to it when the space key is pressed.
We start by getting a reference to the Rigidbody component in the Start() method.

In the Update() method, we check if the space key is pressed. If it is, we call the AddForce() method on the Rigidbody component. 
We pass in two parameters: the direction we want the force to be applied in (which is transform.forward in this case,
meaning the direction the game object is facing), and the amount of force to apply (which is force in this case).

We also pass in a third parameter, ForceMode.Impulse, which specifies the type of force to apply. 
In this case, we're using an impulse force, which applies an instantaneous force to the object.

So when the space key is pressed, the game object will be pushed forward with a force of force in the direction it is facing.
