The Animator.rootRotation property is a Quaternion value that represents the rotation of the root motion of an Animator component.
The root motion is the movement and rotation of the whole character, including its hips, during an animation. 
This property is typically used in combination with the Animator.applyRootMotion property,
which determines whether or not the root motion is applied to the character's Transform.

Here are some details about the Animator.rootRotation property:

* Type: Quaternion
* Access: Get/Set
* Default value: Quaternion.identity
* Scope: Public
* Member of: Animator class

In addition to the standard Quaternion properties and methods, the Animator.rootRotation property has the following properties:

eulerAngles: A Vector3 representing the rotation of the Quaternion in degrees.
Note that modifying this property will also modify the Quaternion itself.


An example of how to use the Animator.rootRotation property to rotate a character based on its root motion:

// Get the Animator component on the character
Animator animator = GetComponent<Animator>();

// Rotate the character based on its root motion
transform.rotation *= animator.rootRotation;

In this example, we first get a reference to the Animator component on the character using GetComponent.
We then rotate the character's Transform by multiplying its current rotation by the Animator.rootRotation value.
This will rotate the character in the direction of its root motion during the current animation.
