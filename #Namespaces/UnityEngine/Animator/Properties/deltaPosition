Animator.deltaPosition is a property of the Animator class in Unity that allows you to get the difference in position of the animated object
between the current and previous frame. This property is of type Vector3 and is read-only.

Here are some important things to note about Animator.deltaPosition:

* The value of Animator.deltaPosition is only valid during the Animator component's OnAnimatorMove callback function. 
  This callback function is called after the Update function and before the LateUpdate function in the same frame.

* Animator.deltaPosition is useful for modifying the position of the animated object in response to its animation. 
  For example, you could use it to move a character based on its animation, or to move an object along a path.

* Because Animator.deltaPosition is only valid during the OnAnimatorMove callback function, you can't use it in other functions like Update or LateUpdate. 
  If you need to use the delta position in other functions, you'll need to store it in a separate variable during the OnAnimatorMove callback.

* If the object being animated has a rigidbody attached, you should not modify its position directly using Animator.deltaPosition.
  Instead, you should modify the rigidbody's position using the rigidbody.MovePosition() method, which takes into account the object's 
  velocity and other physical properties.

An example of how to use Animator.deltaPosition to move an object along a path based on its animation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class MoveAlongPath : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 1f; // speed of movement
    private Vector3 lastPosition; // store the last position of the object
    private Animator animator;

    private void Start()
    {
        animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
        lastPosition = transform.position;
    }

    private void OnAnimatorMove()
    {
        // get the delta position of the object from its animation
        Vector3 deltaPosition = animator.deltaPosition;

        // move the object based on its delta position and speed
        transform.position += deltaPosition * speed;

        // store the current position as the last position
        lastPosition = transform.position;
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we're using Animator.deltaPosition to get the difference in position between the current and previous frame,
and then using that value to move the object along a path. We're also storing the last position of the object in a separate variable, 
so we can use it to calculate the object's velocity if we need to.
