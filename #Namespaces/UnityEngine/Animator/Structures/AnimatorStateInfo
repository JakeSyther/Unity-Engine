"nimatorStateInfo" is a structure that represents information about the current state of an Animator.
Here are some of its main properties and methods:

Properties:

- short fullPathHash: The hash ID of the full path of the state.
- short shortNameHash: The hash ID of the short name of the state.
- float length: The duration of the animation clip.
- float normalizedTime: The current time of the animation clip as a value between 0 and 1.
- float speed: The current playback speed of the animation clip.
- int tagHash: The hash ID of the tag of the state.
- bool loop: Whether the animation clip is set to loop or not.
- bool isName: Whether the state is matched by name or by hash ID.


Methods:

- IsName(string name): Returns true if the state has the specified name.
- IsTag(string tagName): Returns true if the state has the specified tag.
- IsTag(int tagHash): Returns true if the state has the specified tag hash.
- IsName(int nameHash): Returns true if the state has the specified name hash.
- GetHashCode(): Returns the hash code of the AnimatorStateInfo.


In addition, you can access the AnimatorStateInfo of the current state using the Animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo method.

Here is an example:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animator animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo = animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0);

if (stateInfo.IsName("Jump"))
{
    // Do something specific for the Jump state
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we get the current state of the Animator and check if it is the "Jump" state. If it is, we perform some specific actions for that state.
