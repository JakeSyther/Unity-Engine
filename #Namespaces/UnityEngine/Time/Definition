UnityEngine.Time is a class in the Unity game engine that provides access to information about time and timing within a Unity scene.
It allows you to control the flow of time, measure the duration of events, and synchronize your game logic with real-world time.

Here are some of the key properties, methods, structures, and classes available in the UnityEngine.Time class:

Properties:

* deltaTime         : Gets the time in seconds it took to complete the last frame.
* time              : Gets the time in seconds since the start of the game.
* timeScale         : Gets or sets the time scale of the game. This can be used to slow down or speed up the passage of time in your game.
* unscaledDeltaTime : Gets the unscaled time in seconds it took to complete the last frame.
* unscaledTime      : Gets the unscaled time in seconds since the start of the game.

Methods:

* timeSinceLevelLoad()  : Returns the time in seconds since the current level was loaded.
* captureFramerate()    : Sets the target frame rate for the game.
* fixedDeltaTime()      : Gets or sets the fixed time step for the game. This can be used to control the precision of physics simulations in your game.

Structures:

* DeltaTime: A struct that represents the time it took to complete the last frame. It has a float field called seconds, which stores the time in seconds.


Classes:

* TimeManager: A static class that manages the time in a Unity scene. It has methods for controlling the game's time scale,
             capturing the frame rate, and controlling fixed time steps.


These are just a few of the properties, methods, structures, and classes available in the UnityEngine.Time class.
By using UnityEngine.Time in your game logic, you can create dynamic and responsive gameplay experiences that are synchronized with real-world time.
