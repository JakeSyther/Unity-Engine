The Transform.Rotate method allows you to rotate a GameObject around one or more of its axes by a given amount in degrees.
The rotation can be specified in either world or local space, depending on the relativeTo parameter.

Here are the parameters for the Transform.Rotate method:

* Vector3: the amount to rotate the GameObject around each of its axes, in degrees.
* Space relativeTo: whether to rotate the GameObject in world or local space. 

If you pass Space.Self, the rotation is applied in the object's local space; if you pass Space.World, it is applied in world space.

It's important to note that Transform.Rotate modifies the Transform.rotation property, which is a Quaternion that represents the current rotation of the GameObject.

If you want to specify an absolute rotation rather than a relative one, you can set the Transform.rotation property directly instead of using Transform.Rotate.

An example of using Transform.Rotate to rotate a GameObject by a certain amount around its local x-axis:

// Rotate the GameObject 30 degrees around its local x-axis
transform.Rotate(30f, 0f, 0f, Space.Self);

In this example, transform is a reference to the Transform component of the GameObject you want to rotate.

The Space.Self parameter indicates that the rotation should be applied in local space, and the three floats specify the amount to rotate around each axis.
