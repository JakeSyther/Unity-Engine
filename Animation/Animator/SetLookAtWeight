Animator.SetLookAtWeight is a function in the Animator component in the Unity engine. It sets the weight of the look-at effect on a character's head or body.
The Animator.SetLookAtWeight function takes five arguments:

- "bodyWeight" : A float value that sets the weight of the look-at effect on the body.
- "headWeight" : A float value that sets the weight of the look-at effect on the head.
- "eyesWeight" : A float value that sets the weight of the look-at effect on the eyes.
- "clampWeight": A float value that clamps the total weight of the look-at effect.
- "damping"    : A float value that controls the damping of the look-at effect.

Here's an example of how Animator.SetLookAtWeight can be used in a script:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
public Animator animator;

private void Update()
{
    animator.SetLookAtWeight(0.5f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.3f);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the Animator component is attached to a GameObject, and the reference to the component is stored in the animator variable.
The Update function calls animator.SetLookAtWeight to set the weight of the look-at effect on the body to 0.5, on the head to 1.0, on the eyes to 0.0, and clamps
the total weight to 1.0. The damping of the look-at effect is set to 0.3.

Animator.SetLookAtWeight is used in game development to control the weight of the look-at effect on a character's head or body.
This can be useful for adding subtle animations or for creating more convincing artificial intelligence characters.

Another example:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
public Animator animator;
public Transform target;

private void Update()
{
    Vector3 targetPosition = target.position;
    Vector3 currentPosition = transform.position;
    Vector3 lookDirection = targetPosition - currentPosition;

    float angle = Vector3.Angle(transform.forward, lookDirection);
    float bodyWeight = Mathf.Lerp(0.0f, 1.0f, angle / 180.0f);

    animator.SetLookAtWeight(bodyWeight, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.3f);
    animator.SetLookAtPosition(targetPosition);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, there's a target Transform and an Animator component attached to a GameObject.
The Update function calculates the direction from the current position to the target position using lookDirection = targetPosition - currentPosition.

The angle between the current forward direction and the lookDirection is calculated using Vector3.Angle.
The bodyWeight variable is calculated by linear interpolation between 0.0 and 1.0 using Mathf.Lerp and the angle.

The animator.SetLookAtWeight function is called to set the weight of the look-at effect on the body, head and eyes.
The bodyWeight variable is passed as the first argument to set the weight of the look-at effect on the body, and the 1.0f value
is passed as the second argument to set the full weight of the look-at effect on the head. The damping of the look-at effect is set to 0.3.

The animator.SetLookAtPosition function is called to set the position for the character to look at.

This example shows how to use Animator.SetLookAtWeight and Animator.SetLookAtPosition to make the character look at a target
and smoothly rotate their body towards the target, depending on the angle between the target and the character's forward direction.
