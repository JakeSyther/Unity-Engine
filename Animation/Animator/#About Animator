The Animator component in Unity is used to control animations on GameObjects.
It allows you to create animations using the Animation Window, and then play and control those animations through script.
The Animator component integrates with Unity's Animation system, and can blend animations, transition between animations,
and control various animation properties such as speed and weight.

An example of how you can use the Animator component in a script:

---------------------------------------------------
public class AnimatorExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Animator animator;

    void Start()
    {
        animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            animator.SetTrigger("Jump");
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------
In this example, the Start method gets a reference to the Animator component attached to the GameObject by using the GetComponent method.
The Update method then checks for the user pressing the space bar each frame, and when it detects that the space bar has been pressed,
it triggers the "Jump" animation by calling animator.SetTrigger("Jump").
