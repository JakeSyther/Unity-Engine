The Animator.SetLookAtPosition function sets a position for the character's head to look at. 
It takes one argument: a Vector3 value that represents the position in world space that the character should look at.

Example of how Animator.SetLookAtPosition can be used in a script:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
public Animator animator;

private void Update()
{
    Vector3 targetPosition = new Vector3(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
    animator.SetLookAtPosition(targetPosition);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the Animator component is attached to a GameObject, and the reference to the component is stored in the animator variable.
The Update function sets the target position to (1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f) and calls animator.SetLookAtPosition to set the position for the character's head to look at.

Animator.SetLookAtPosition is used in game development to control the direction that a character's head is facing.
This can be useful for adding subtle animations or for creating more convincing artificial intelligence characters.


More complex example:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
public Animator animator;
public Transform target;

private void Update()
{
    Vector3 targetPosition = target.position;
    Vector3 currentPosition = transform.position;
    Vector3 lookDirection = targetPosition - currentPosition;

    animator.SetLookAtPosition(targetPosition);
    animator.SetLookAtWeight(1.0f, 0.3f, 0.6f, 1.0f, 0.5f);

    Vector3 bodyDirection = Vector3.Lerp(transform.forward, lookDirection, 0.1f);
    animator.SetLookAtPosition(bodyDirection);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, there's a target Transform and an Animator component attached to a GameObject.
The Update function calculates the direction from the current position to the target position using lookDirection = targetPosition - currentPosition.

The animator.SetLookAtPosition function is called to set the position for the character's head to look at.
The animator.SetLookAtWeight function is called to set the weight of the look-at effect on the character's head.
The 1.0f value in the SetLookAtWeight function sets the full weight of the look-at effect on the head.

The bodyDirection variable is calculated by linear interpolation of the current forward direction and the lookDirection using Vector3.Lerp with t = 0.1f.
The animator.SetLookAtPosition function is called again to set the direction for the character's body to look at.

This example shows a more complex use case of Animator.SetLookAtPosition and Animator.SetLookAtWeight, where the direction of the character's
body and head are set to look at the target position. This can be useful for creating more sophisticated artificial intelligence characters
or for adding subtle animations to the character.
