AnimationCurve is a type of data structure in Unity that is used to define the motion of objects over time.
It's commonly used in animation, physics simulations, and other areas where you need to interpolate between keyframe values over time.

The AnimationCurve class allows you to specify a set of keyframes that define the value of an animated property at specific points in time.
You can control the shape of the curve between the keyframes by manipulating the tangent handles of each keyframe, which determine the rate of change
of the value over time. The AnimationCurve class provides a number of methods for evaluating the curve at any point in time, including evaluating the curve's value,
its derivative (rate of change), and its integral (accumulated value).

 The AnimationCurve can be used to animate the value of various properties over time. Some common uses for AnimationCurves in Unity include:

- Animating object properties: You can use AnimationCurves to animate the position, rotation, scale, and other properties of objects over time.

- Controlling particle effects: You can use AnimationCurves to control the behavior of particle systems, such as the size, speed, and color of particles over time.

- Easing animations: You can use AnimationCurves to create custom easing functions that you can use in your animations.
  This allows you to control the speed and progression of animations in a flexible and intuitive way.

To create an AnimationCurve, you add keys to the curve using the AnimationCurve.AddKey method.
Each key has a time value and a value, which defines the state of the curve at that point in time.
You can manipulate the shape of the curve by adjusting the tangent handles of the keys,
which determine the rate of change of the curve's value.

The AnimationCurve class provides several methods for evaluating the curve at any point in time,
including Evaluate, EvaluateTangent, and GetKey. You can use these methods to determine the value of the curve at a specific time,
the rate of change of the curve's value, and the time and value of specific keys on the curve.

In addition to the AnimationCurve class, Unity also provides several other classes and components that make it easy to use AnimationCurves in your projects.
For example, the Animation component allows you to create animations by specifying AnimationCurves for various properties, 
and the ParticleSystem component provides a number of built-in AnimationCurves for controlling the behavior of particle systems.
