In Unity, MonoBehaviour is a class that allows a script to interact with the Unity engine.
Any script in Unity that needs to interact with the game engine or be attached to a GameObject in a scene must inherit from MonoBehaviour.
This class contains various methods and properties that can be overridden to execute code at different stages of the game loop.



MonoBehaviour allows you to access and modify game objects and components in the scene, set up event handlers, create custom animation states, and much more.
By inheriting from MonoBehaviour, you can write scripts that can be attached to GameObjects in the scene, and can interact with the game world.

Some of the methods available in MonoBehaviour include:

1. Awake(): Called when the script is first loaded and the GameObject is created. This method is often used for initialization that can't be done in the Start() method,
   such as finding references to other objects in the scene or setting up default values.
   
2. Start(): Called at the beginning of the first frame in which the script is active. This method is often used for initialization that can't be done in the Awake() 
   method, such as setting up references to other objects or components that have been initialized during the Awake() phase.
   
3. Update(): Called once per frame, used to update the state of the script. This method is often used for updating the position, rotation, or other properties of
   the GameObject based on user input or game state.
   
4. FixedUpdate(): Called once per physics update. This method is often used for physics calculations, such as moving rigidbodies or applying forces to them.

5. LateUpdate(): Called once per frame, after all other Update() methods have been called. This method is often used for camera or GUI-related
   updates that need to happen after other updates have occurred.
   
6. OnGUI(): Called whenever the GUI needs to be rendered. This method is often used for creating custom GUI elements or for rendering debug information on the screen.

7. OnDisable(): Called when the GameObject is disabled. This method is often used for cleaning up resources or state that was allocated during the Awake()
   or Start() methods.

8. OnEnable(): Called when the GameObject is enabled. This method is often used for initializing state or resources that are needed for the 
   GameObject to function properly.
   
9. OnDestroy(): Called when the GameObject is about to be destroyed. This method is often used for cleaning up resources or state that was
   allocated during the Awake() or Start() methods, or for unregistering event handlers.

10. OnApplicationQuit(): Called when the application is about to quit. This method is often used for cleaning up resources or saving game
    state before the application is closed.

Each of these methods can be overridden in a subclass of MonoBehaviour to provide custom behavior for the GameObject that the script is attached to.

"While these are the primary methods available in the MonoBehaviour class, there are many other methods and functions available
in Unity that can be used to customize the behavior of your GameObjects. To become a proficient Unity developer,
it is worth searching for and practicing with these additional methods and functions."
