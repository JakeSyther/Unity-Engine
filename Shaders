Unity Shaders refer to small programs that describe the behavior and appearance of individual pixels in a scene.
They can be used to create visual effects, enhance the look and feel of a scene, or adjust the properties of objects in a scene,
such as their color, texture, and lighting. Shaders can be written in a language called ShaderLab and are typically combined with materials to create a complete,
renderered appearance. There are many different types of shaders, including surface shaders, which describe how light interacts with an object's surface,
and vertex shaders, which control the transformation and manipulation of vertices in a 3D model.


Unity has a variety of built-in shaders, including:

1. Standard Shaders:
  -Standard
  -Standard (Specular setup)
  -Standard (Roughness setup)
  -Standard (Metallic setup)
2. Particles Shaders:
  -Particles/Additive
  -Particles/Alpha Blended
  -Particles/Multiply
  -Particles/Vertex Lit
3. Legacy Shaders:
  -Legacy/Diffuse
  -Legacy/Diffuse Detail
  -Legacy/Bumped Diffuse
  -Legacy/Bumped Specular
  -Legacy/VertexLit
  -Legacy/Lightmapped/Diffuse
  -Legacy/Transparent/Cutout/Diffuse
4. Nature/Tree Shaders:
  -Nature/Tree Creator Leaves
  -Nature/Tree Soft Occlusion Bark
5. UI Shaders:
  -UI/Default
  -UI/Mask
  -UI/Additive
  -UI/Soft Additive
  -UI/Transparent
6. Lightweight Render Pipeline Shaders:
  -Lightweight Render Pipeline/Lit
  -Lightweight Render Pipeline/Unlit
  -Lightweight Render Pipeline/Particles/Additive
  -Lightweight Render Pipeline/Particles/Alpha Blended
7. Shader Graph Shaders:
  -Shader Graph/Examples/Lit Master
  
These are some of the built-in shaders provided by Unity. 
It's worth noting that you can also create custom shaders in Unity using Shader Graph or by writing your own shader code in ShaderLab (a variant of HLSL).
