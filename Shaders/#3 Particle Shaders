Particle shaders in Unity are specifically designed for use with the Particle System component.
They determine the appearance of each particle in the system, such as its size, color, transparency, and shape.
Particle shaders use a combination of texture maps and algorithms to create the desired visual effects.

Some of the built-in particle shaders in Unity include:

1. Particles/Alpha Blended: This shader uses an alpha channel to blend the particle with the background, allowing for smooth transparency.
2. Particles/Additive: This shader adds the particle color to the background, resulting in bright, glowing effects.
3. Particles/Multiply: This shader multiplies the particle color with the background, darkening it and creating shadow-like effects.
4. Particles/VertexLit: This shader is used to create particle effects that are lit by the scene lights and cast shadows.
5. Particles/Multiply Blended: This shader combines the multiply and alpha blended shaders to create particles that darken the background and have smooth transparency.

There are many other particle shaders available, and you can also create your own custom shaders to achieve unique visual effects. When creating custom particle shaders,
it's important to have a good understanding of shader programming and the math behind the algorithms used to generate the effects.
