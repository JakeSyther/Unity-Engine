- lerp(a, b, t): linearly interpolates between two values a and b based on a blend factor t.
- saturate(x): clamps a value x between 0 and 1.
- step(a, b): returns 1 if a is less than or equal to b, and 0 otherwise.
- mul(a, b): multiplies two matrices or vectors.
- tex2D(sampler, coord): samples a 2D texture using a sampler object and texture coordinates.
- tex2Dlod(sampler, coord, lod): samples a 2D texture using a sampler object, texture coordinates, and a specified level of detail.
- tex2Dbias(sampler, bias): samples a 2D texture using a sampler object and a bias value to adjust the level of detail.
- tex3D(sampler, coord): samples a 3D texture using a sampler object and texture coordinates.
- texCUBE(sampler, coord): samples a cubemap texture using a sampler object and texture coordinates.
- lerp(a, b, t): linearly interpolates between two values a and b based on a blend factor t.
- lerp(a, b, t): linearly interpolates between two values a and b based on a blend factor t.
- lerp(a, b, t):

There are many more functions and directives available in the Unity Shader Language,
and their functionality can vary depending on the context in which they are used.
It's worth noting that many of these functions are also common to other shader languages, like HLSL or GLSL.

Some links to the official Unity documentation for the ShaderLab language, which includes a full reference of available functions and directives:

These resources provide a comprehensive overview of the ShaderLab language, including its syntax, 
available functions and directives, and best practices for writing shaders in Unity.
