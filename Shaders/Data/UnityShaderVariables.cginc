UnityShaderVariables.cginc is another shader include file used in Unity3D game engine, which contains a collection of pre-defined shader variables
and macros that provide useful information and functions for creating custom shaders.

UnityShaderVariables.cginc is included in many of the built-in shaders provided by Unity, and can also be used in custom shaders created by developers.
It helps developers to write shaders that are optimized for performance, as well as simplify the process of writing shaders by providing pre-defined variables
and macros for common operations


Some of the key features provided by UnityShaderVariables.cginc include:


1. Pre-defined shader variables that provide useful information about the current rendering context.
   These variables include the current world position of the pixel being rendered, the current view direction, and the screen position of the pixel being rendered.
2. Macros for defining textures and sampling them, which can help simplify the process of working with textures in shaders.
3. Macros for defining lighting models, which can help simplify the process of implementing common lighting models such as Blinn-Phong and Lambert.
4. Macros for defining color spaces and converting between them, which can help ensure that the color output
   of shaders is consistent across different platforms and devices.
5. Macros for defining surface properties, such as the surface normal and the tangent space, which can help simplify
   the process of calculating lighting and other surface effects.
   
   
Overall, UnityShaderVariables.cginc is a valuable tool for Unity developers who want to create high-quality shaders with minimal effort.
It provides pre-defined variables and macros that can help simplify the process of writing shaders,
while also ensuring that the resulting shaders are optimized for performance.
The file is regularly updated by Unity's development team to support new features and improve performance,
making it an essential component of the Unity game engine's rendering pipeline.
