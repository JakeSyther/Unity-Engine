1. float3 UnityObjectToWorldNormal(float3 norm)

   This function transforms a normal vector from object space to world space. 
   It takes an object space normal as input and returns the corresponding world space normal.
   
2. float3 UnityWorldToObjectNormal(float3 norm)

   This function transforms a normal vector from world space to object space.
   It takes a world space normal as input and returns the corresponding object space normal.
   
3. float4 UnityObjectToWorldPos(float4 pos)

   This function transforms a position vector from object space to world space. 
   It takes an object space position as input and returns the corresponding world space position.

4. float4 UnityWorldToObjectPos(float4 pos)

   This function transforms a position vector from world space to object space.
   It takes a world space position as input and returns the corresponding object space position.
   
5. float3 UnityObjectToViewPos(float4 pos)

   This function transforms a position vector from object space to view space.
   It takes an object space position as input and returns the corresponding view space position.

6. float3 UnityViewToWorldPos(float3 pos)

   This function transforms a position vector from view space to world space.
   It takes a view space position as input and returns the corresponding world space position.

7. float3 UnityWorldToViewPos(float3 pos)

   This function transforms a position vector from world space to view space.
   It takes a world space position as input and returns the corresponding view space position.

These helper functions can be very useful in Unity shader development, as they simplify the process of transforming vectors between different coordinate spaces.
They can be used in both vertex and fragment shaders to transform positions and normals, and to perform other common operations.
